cervical tumor segmentation using u-net, calculating dice coefficient


Cervical cancer (CC) is the most prevalent gynecologic malignancy worldwide. Tumor segmentation is a crucial step for radiotherapy treatment planning. Each image volume is examined slice-by-slice from various orientations in order to define an accurate segmentation of the primary tumor of cervical cancer patients using simultaneous assessment of single image modalities. Moreover, the manual fixed boundary of segmentation ignores the recognized occurrence of spatial ambiguity in tumor delineation. To facilitate the process of slice-by-slice adaptive segmentation of MRI images, this research proposes a fully automatic deep learning (DL) model for the 3D segmentation of primary CC lesions. We utilize the MONAI deep learning library, specifically designed for 3D medical imaging segmentation, to construct and train our model. The performance of the DL algorithm in segmenting the gross volume tumor (GTV) was assessed using dice coefficients. Notably, the proposed model achieved a dice coefficient of 0.88, outperforming the single-modal MRI segmentation models, thereby demonstrating its efficacy in accurately extracting GTV segmentations.
